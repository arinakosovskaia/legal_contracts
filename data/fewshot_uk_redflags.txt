========================
FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES (EXTENDED, HIGH-CONTEXT)
Use as guidance patterns. Helpful cues are NOT mandatory; they are heuristics.
Always require verbatim evidence from TEXT CHUNK for any finding.
========================

GLOBAL RULES TO REDUCE FALSE POSITIVES (DO NOT FLAG)
A) Emergency entry:
   - Do NOT flag entry clauses limited to genuine emergencies (fire, flood, gas leak, serious safety risk).
B) Reasonable notice entry:
   - Do NOT flag clauses that require reasonable notice (e.g., "24 hours' written notice") and reasonable times for non-emergency access.
C) Lawful notice/termination:
   - Do NOT flag clauses explicitly requiring written notice and compliance with statutory requirements/minimum notice.
D) Fees/payments:
   - Do NOT flag clauses that restrict fees to those "permitted by law" AND do not impose specific extra fees.
E) Service charges:
   - Do NOT flag clauses limited to "reasonable" costs, supported by evidence/receipts, with tenant ability to challenge.
F) Repairs / tenant duties:
   - Do NOT flag normal tenant obligations (cleanliness, minor upkeep) unless they clearly shift statutory landlord repair/safety duties or remove tenant remedies.

GLOBAL RULES FOR QUOTES & OUTPUT BEHAVIOR
1) Every selected category must have a verbatim quote that directly supports the red flag.
2) If you cannot quote it, do NOT flag it.
3) Prefer fewer, stronger findings over many weak ones.

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY: Deposits & Deposit Protection
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "returned at landlord’s convenience"
- "deposit may be transferred to landlord's personal account"
- "deposit protection is optional/not required"
- "no timeframe" / "indefinite"
- "any deductions landlord decides" / "at landlord discretion"
- mandatory cleaning/repainting regardless of condition

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Deposit will be returned at landlord’s convenience. No fixed timeframe for return of deposit."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Deposits & Deposit Protection"
- Quote: "returned at landlord’s convenience" (verbatim)
- Core point: open-ended landlord discretion, unclear/indefinite return.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The deposit will be returned within 10 working days after the tenancy ends, subject to evidenced deductions for damage beyond fair wear and tear."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The deposit will be protected in an authorised tenancy deposit scheme as required by law and the prescribed information will be provided to the Tenant."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- If a clause mentions deductions, only flag if it allows arbitrary deductions ("any sum landlord decides") or automatic deductions (e.g., mandatory professional cleaning regardless of condition).
- If it’s just “reasonable deductions for damage beyond fair wear and tear” → usually no finding.

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY: Licensing & Regulatory Compliance
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "gas safety checks are unnecessary"
- "no certificates required"
- "tenant waives safety requirements"
- "as-is; landlord not responsible for safety/compliance"
- "tenant responsible for statutory checks/inspections"

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Tenant accepts that gas safety checks are unnecessary. Landlord is not responsible for providing safety certificates."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Licensing & Regulatory Compliance"
- Quote: "gas safety checks are unnecessary" / "not responsible for providing safety certificates"
- Core point: attempts to waive statutory obligations / misleading.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Landlord will comply with all safety and licensing obligations and will provide required certificates upon request."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The Tenant must test smoke alarms regularly. This does not affect the Landlord’s statutory safety obligations."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- Tenant duties like “test smoke alarms” can be fine, but if the clause shifts landlord duties (“tenant responsible for gas safety certificate”) → flag.

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY: Notice Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "oral notice"
- "notice of any length chosen by the landlord"
- "immediate termination" / "without notice"
- "no written notice required"
- "no consultation required" (especially around major works if that’s the context)

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant oral notice or written notice of any length chosen by the landlord."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Notice Requirements"
- Quote: "oral notice" and/or "any length chosen by the landlord"
- Core point: undermines written notice/minimum notice safeguards.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Any notice must be in writing and comply with all statutory requirements, including any minimum notice periods."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Notices may be served by email or post, provided they are in writing."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- If the clause just describes how to serve notice (post/email) and clearly keeps it written → usually no finding.
- Flag when it reduces notice to oral, discretionary, or “any length”.

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY: Possession, Eviction & Court Process
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "without applying to the court"
- "immediate possession" / "re-enter"
- "tenant must leave immediately"
- "forfeiture" used as self-help while tenant occupies
- "evict at any time"

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"When the tenancy ends, the landlord may take back possession immediately and require any occupier still living in the premises to leave without applying to the court."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Possession, Eviction & Court Process"
- Quote: "leave without applying to the court"
- Core point: bypasses lawful eviction procedure.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The landlord may seek possession by following the statutory procedure and obtaining a court order where required."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"This clause does not affect the tenant’s statutory protections regarding eviction."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- If the clause is purely about “seeking possession” and references lawful routes → usually no finding.
- If it implies immediate removal without court → flag (high severity).

CATEGORY: Quiet Enjoyment & Occupier Rights
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "enter at any time"
- "without notice"

TEXT CHUNK:
"Landlord may enter the property at any time without notice. The tenant must provide access whenever requested."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Quiet Enjoyment & Occupier Rights"
- Quote: "at any time without notice"
- Core point: unrestricted entry undermines quiet enjoyment.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Landlord may enter with at least 24 hours’ written notice at a reasonable time for inspections/repairs, except in genuine emergencies."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"In an emergency, the Landlord may enter without notice to prevent serious damage or ensure safety."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- “Reasonable notice + reasonable times + specific purposes” → usually fair.
- “Any time / without notice / whenever requested” → likely red flag.

------------------------------------------------------------

HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "administration fee" / "reference fee" / "check-out fee"

- "loan to landlord"
- automatic landlord legal costs charged to tenant

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The tenant must pay the landlord a non-refundable administration fee of £300 as a condition of entering into the tenancy."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Rent, Fees & Prohibited Payments"
- Quote: "non-refundable administration fee of £300"

TEXT CHUNK:
"No fees are payable by the tenant in connection with this tenancy except payments permitted by law."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The Tenant shall not be required to make any loan to the Landlord or to any other person in connection with this tenancy."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- If clause says “fees as permitted by law” but then lists specific admin fees → flag (the list is evidence).
- If it only says “permitted by law” and no extra fees → usually no finding.

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY: Tenancy Type & Security of Tenure
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "statutory protections do not apply"
- "tenant waives statutory rights"
- "fitness protections disapplied"
- "this is not a tenancy" when it clearly is residential occupancy (be cautious: only act on what’s in chunk)

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Statutory protections do not apply to this tenancy type. Fitness protections are expressly disapplied."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Tenancy Type & Security of Tenure"
- Quote: "Statutory protections do not apply"
- Core point: attempts to contract out of mandatory protections.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The parties acknowledge that statutory rights apply where relevant and cannot be excluded by contract."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES

------------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORY: Unfair Terms & Consumer Protection
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- tenant loses remedies for landlord breach ("no compensation", "no set-off", "must pay regardless")

- exclusion of liability (especially personal injury/death due to negligence)
- excessive penalties/late fees unrelated to loss
- non-refundable sums retained even if landlord cancels
- forced arbitration/no court access
- "sole discretion" to decide disputes unilaterally

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Tenant must pay full rent even when landlord fails to provide essential repairs."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Unfair Terms & Consumer Protection"
- Quote: "must pay full rent even when landlord fails"
- Core point: strips tenant remedies / significant imbalance.

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"This agreement becomes binding when signed by both parties."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"Late payment interest may be charged only as permitted by law and only to the extent reasonable."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- Clauses about “rent must be paid” are normal; flag only when it explicitly removes remedies even for landlord breach or imposes one-sided terms.

CATEGORY: Unlawful Eviction & Harassment
------------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL CUES (non-exhaustive; not mandatory)
- "change the locks"
- "remove/dispose of belongings"

- "harass" / "pressure" / "enter to remove occupiers" (be evidence-led)

[TRUE POSITIVE]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The landlord may remove the tenant’s belongings or change the locks if the landlord decides the tenancy should end."

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Flag "Unlawful Eviction & Harassment"
- Quote: "remove the tenant’s belongings" and/or "change the locks"
- Core point: self-help eviction/harassment indicators (high severity).

[HARD NEGATIVE #1]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The Landlord shall not unlawfully deprive the Tenant of occupation of the Property and will recover possession only through the lawful process."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

[HARD NEGATIVE #2]
TEXT CHUNK:
"The Landlord may change the locks only after the Tenant has lawfully surrendered the property and returned all keys, and in accordance with the law."

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"findings": []}

BORDERLINE NOTES
- Any clause suggesting lock changes/removal of belongings while tenant occupies → treat as high-risk red flag.
- If the clause is explicitly after lawful surrender + in accordance with law → typically not a finding.
